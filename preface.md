## What to Expect from This Book
* not be able to handle the really advanced situations but get respectable expertise in processing and translating complex languages.
* explains how existing language applications works, see many sample implementations.
* focus on building apps for languages already exist.
* when talking about language apps, we're talking about any program processing, analyzing or translating an input file, not just a compiler or interpreter.
* many patterns to build language apps for any computer language, including DSL(domain specific language) or GPPL(general purpose programming language).


## How This Book Is Organized
1. Getting Started with Parsing: looking at the over-all architecture of language apps, then jump into the key language recognition patterns.
2. Analyzing Languages: To analyze DSLs and programming languages, build trees represent language constructs.
3. Building Interpreters: 
4. Translating and Generating Languages:

## What You’ll Find in the Patterns
Each pattern has four parts:
1. Purpose:  describes what the pattern is for, scan the Purpose section before jumping into a pattern to discover exactly what it’s trying to solve.
2. Discussion: explains when to use the pattern, and describes how the pattern works.
3. Implementation: 
4. Related Patterns.
